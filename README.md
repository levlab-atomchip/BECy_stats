Code pertaining to data analysis for the 
Atom Chip Microscope experiment in Lev Lab

This code is primarily concerned with parsing data from the .mat
files put out by our imaging GUI and extracting physical 
quantities of interest, in particular atom number.

These quantities can be further processed across a distribution
of images to yield parameters such as atom cloud lifetime.
